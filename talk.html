# Verification and Concurrency
### Susanne van den Elsen
Native Instruments

February 21, 2017

# Introduction
---

# Why use multiple threads?
- Abstraction for modeling concurrent activities
- Use multiple CPU cores for speeding up computation

---

# Concurrency Errors
- Improper use of POSIX threads API
- Data race: multiple threads access the same memory location concurrently and at least one of them modifies the memory
- Deadlock: One more more threads wait for eachother indefinitely
- False sharing: Threads running on different processor cores access different variables located in the same cache line frequently. This will slow down the involved threads due to frequent exchange of cache lines
- Lock contention: One thread blocks the progress of other threads by holding a lock too long

???
Most devs know Valgrind as a memcheck tool, but that is actually only one of the tools it comes with.
A less well-known tool is Helgrind.
The nul-tool inserts no instrumentation and causes a 4x slowdown

POSIX:
- Shared address space among threads. All data (shared and non-shared is identified by its address)
- Threads represent a concurrent activity
- Synchronisation objects: mutexes, condition variables, semaphores, reader-writer synchronisation objects, barriers, spinlocks
---

# ThreadSanitizer & Helgrind: Data Races
- Monitor all accesses to memory locations
- If memory location is accessed by two different threads, checks whether the two accesses are
  ordered by a happens-before relation
- If not, a race is reported

<img src='http://g.gravizo.com/g?
digraph data_race {
    node [shape=none];
    "1 write y" [shape=box, color=blue];
    "2 read y" [shape=box, color=blue];
    "2 write x" -> "2 read x" -> "2 read y" -> "2 write z";
}
'/>

---

<img src='http://g.gravizo.com/g?
digraph data_race_branch {
    node [shape=none];
    "1 read x" [shape=box, color=red];
    "1 write y" [shape=box, color=blue];
    "2 write x" [shape=box, color=red];
    "2 read x" [shape=box, color=red];
    "2 read y" [shape=box, color=blue];
    "1 read x" -> "1 write y";
    "2 write x" -> "2 read x" -> "2 read y" -> "2 write z";
}
'/>

---

<img src='http://g.gravizo.com/g?
digraph data_race_branch_fix {
    node [shape=none];
    "1 lock m";
    "1 read x" [shape=box, color=red];
    "1 unlock m";
    "1 write y" [shape=box, color=blue];
    "2 lock m";
    "2 write x" [shape=box, color=red];
    "2 unlock m";
    "2 read x" [shape=box, color=red];
    "2 read y" [shape=box, color=blue];
    "1 lock m" -> "1 read x" -> "1 unlock m" -> "1 write y";
    "2 lock m" -> "2 write x" -> "2 unlock m" -> "2 read x" -> "2 read y" -> "2 write z";
    "1 unlock m" -> "2 lock m" [style=dotted, label=hb]
}

???
- Happens-before relation: There is a chain of synchronisation oeprations which cause those accesses to happen in a
particular order
- Partial ordering: some elements may be unordered with respect to each other
---

# A Closer Look at DRD
Result of load/store operations depends on order in which they are performed. This order consists of
- Thread order: operations performed by the same thread are ordered by the program (but may nonetheless depend on the results of previous load/store operations);
- Synchronization order: Ordering constraints on operations performed by different threads
- Together they form the Happens-Before order
- A program is data-race free if all conflicting memory accesses are ordered by synchronization operations
- HB methods do *not* report false pasitives
---


- Example where this is insufficient
---

# ThreadSanitizer: Deadlock

- Maintains a directed graph of lock aquisitions
- An edge ```lock_object1 -> lock_object2``` is added iff a thread aquires a lock on ```lock_object2``` while holding a lock on ```lock_object1```
- A cycle in the graph corresponds to a potential deadlock

.center[
<img src='http://g.gravizo.com/g?
digraph deadlock {
    node [shape=none];
    edge [minlen=0.75, arrowsize=0.5]
    "lock forks[0]" -> "lock forks[1]" [label="thread 1"];
    "lock forks[1]" -> "lock forks[0]" [label="thread 2"];
}
'/>
]

# Nondeterminism
- Concurrency errors notoriously difficult to catch: traditional testing not sufficient to find/reproduce errors

- OS / VM Scheduler can be preempt threads at any time (beyond control of programmer)
- Timing conditions

- Abstraction of threads: these decisions are offloaded to the scheduler.
---

# State Space Explosion
- Combinatorial explosion

- Worst-case example: n threads with 1 local variable each: n! (exponential) interleavings, and only a single outcome
---

# State Space Reduction
- Reduce the number of interleavings explored
- Versus coverage guarantees: quantify the class / number of interleavings seen
---

# Randomized Testing
- Citation:
- Gives *some* (probabilistic) guarantees
---

# Systematic Testing
- Systematically see a subset of interleavings
---

# Bounded Search
- Define a bound function bf on interleaving and give a bound k
- Only explore those interleaving for which bf(interleaving) less or equal k
+ Incremental
+ Fast
+ Some guarantees
- Incomplete
- Redundancy
---

# Partial Order Reduction
- Equivalence relation on interleavings
- Ideally explore exactly one representative per equivalence class
+ Complete
- Non-incremental
- For nontrivial programs still too little reduction

- Dependence relation on instructions
- Happens-before relation on instructions
- HB = Partial Order = Equivalence
